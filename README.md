# Uber-Supply-Demand-Analysis
This project analyzes Uber request data to identify major gaps between supply (drivers) and demand (riders). The goal was to find out why only 42% of trips are completed and recommend strategies to reduce cancellations and increase availability in critical locations like the Airport and City.
